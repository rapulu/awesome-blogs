# Contributing Guide

## Creating a PR
- Fork the repo.
- Clone the repo to your local machine.

Open up `readme.md` and add your personal blog or one you know to the list!

The only rules are all blogs submitted must:

- Be a custom website (not dev [dot] to, Medium or Blogger)
- Be on a personal domain (kelvin [dot] com/vuejs not blogspot [dot] com/kelvin)
- Have personal content (not company news or reblogging)
- Be put in the right category!
- Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first come first serve.
- Avoid duplicates in a category

## Updating repo

If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
